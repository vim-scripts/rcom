The rcom ftplugin uses the RCom interface (http://rcom.univie.ac.at)
to the R Statistical Package (http://www.r-project.org) for sending 
code to a running instance of R. This way any R snippet can be easily 
evaluated in that instance of R GUI.

After installation, interaction with R via rcom is enabled for all
buffers with filetype r. For other filetypes, you can use the
functions |rcom#EvaluateInBuffer()|.

Features:

    - Evaluate R code
    - Omnicompletion for R
    - Maps for normal, visual, and insert mode
    - Keyword map (|K|)
    - Operator

Normal usage~

    1. Start an instance of R GUI and load the image you want.
    2. Open an R source file in VIM.
    3. Type <c-cr> to evaluate the current line/visual area in R.
    4. Type [count]+ or +{motion} to evaluate some text in R. (You can 
       type ++ to invoke |+|.)
